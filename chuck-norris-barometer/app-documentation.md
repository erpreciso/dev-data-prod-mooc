## App description and how2 guide

### Overview
This app wants to define if Chuck Norris is seen as a good or a bad entity by measuring the **polarity** *(see glossary)* of a pool of randomly chosen **facts** *(see glossary)*, and return it in a density plot. User can visually get the comparison between the part of the density graph higher that 0 (volume of positive score) and the part lower than 0 (volume of negative score), and read it as a measure of positive or negative sensation transmitted.

Sentences are randomly chosed from a database of Chuck Norris facts via http request on its API.

User can modify the sentence pool size with the slider, and the random sample is updated instantaneously. In the center panel are reported the facts values (plain text sentences) extracted from the database, and in the right panel there's the density plot, reporting the polarity value on the x-axis.

Polarity score is calculated using the <code>qdap</code> CRAN package: please refer to the package documentation for an exhaustive algorithm description.

### Under the hood: statistical methodology?

This app has been built not only for fun but as course project for [Coursera - Developing Data Products MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod), offered by the [John Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/jhu).

Scope of this project is creating, deploying and sharing a working Rstudio Shiny app; while the output plot returned has very low informative content, it is based on some strong fundamentals:

- polarity function from the [qdap Natural Language Processing R package](https://trinker.github.io/qdap/);

- [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) app server;

- reactive input / output algorithm;

- http GET request to a web API.

### Glossary

**Polarity**: Polarity assignment, a form of sentiment analysis, is using an algorithm to determine the polarity of a sentence/statement. The polarity score generated by the polarity function used in this app is dependent upon the word polarity dictionary used by [Hu & Liu (2004)](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html). *from [qdap package vignette](https://trinker.github.io/qdap/vignettes/qdap_vignette.html#polarity)*


**Fact**: Chuck Norris 'facts' are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an Internet phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular culture. The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris' toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity. *from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts)*
